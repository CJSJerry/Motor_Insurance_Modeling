# Demo: Motor Insurance Modeling with GLM and Neural Network

This is a demo of using both the industry standard (generalized linear model) and artifical neural network to predict the claim amount of a motor insurance claim record. Pre-processing and visualization for all variables are also included. Note that Annual claim amount is often referred to as _severity_ in the actuarial literature, but since we do not delve into the annualiztion of the claim amount here, the term _severity_ simply refers to the claim amount for the purpose of this demo.

## Contents

- `motor_insurance.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis.
- `insurance_data_sample.csv`: CSV file containing the data used in the notebook.
- `main.py`: The same code as in the notebook but without the interactive features.

## Usage
### Running the Jupyter Notebook
To view and run the Notebook, open motor_insurance.ipynb in a Jupyter environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab) or directly on Github.

### Running the Python Script
To execute the analysis using the Python script, run the following command in your terminal:
```sh
python main.py
```
Make sure that you have all the necessary libraries installed first.
